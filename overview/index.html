    Here are a few key points about Vovinam martial program
  </h2>
  <p>Vovinam martial art program starts with the training of kicks, punches and stances. More than 2 years are dedicated to train students to be efficient in executing the foundational moves. Altogether, there are about 120 techniques ranging from self-defence, arm lock to pressure point manipulation to be learnt. During that time, the body will develop in strength, endurance, toughness, reaction and flexibility.</p>
  <p>Concurrently, students will learn to correctly fall and roll. This can be intimidating as one may not be used to doing such. However once the techniques become instinctive, the students would be able to safely fall and roll in training and everyday life. An account told by one of our instructors describes how his bicycle got into a sudden stop when hitting an obstacle. He was falling face first onto the concrete. Thanks to his training, he was able to execute the forward roll and walked away from it unscratched.</p>
  <p>Once students reach their yellow belt (instructor’s belt), they will learn how to use weapons and disarm attackers with weapons. The weapons training program varies between different masters however they usually go in order of dagger/knife, sword, long staff, sabre, ruler, axe, machete and riffle.</p>
  <p>Vovinam’s weapon training is both comprehensive and in-depth. For example sword training has 15 basic sword techniques that teach students the correct use of the swords. Then are 15 counters which train the students how to react to sword attack. After that, there are the sword forms: Tinh Hoa Luỡng Nghi Kiếm and Song Luyện Kiếm, which are practised individually and with partners respectively. These forms are used as simulations to sword fights to train adaptation and combat experience.</p>
  <p>Another essential part of Vovinam is wrestling which is derived from the Vietnamese traditional wrestling. There are 28 wrestling techniques being taught from Blue Belts (practitioners) to Red Belts (masters). These techniques help students further develop in strength, balance, posture and understanding of body mechanics.</p>
  <p>The most famous Vovinam techniques are the 21 đòn chân or leg techniques. This is a group of grappling techniques that is designed to grab the opponent using legs or feet. This can be used to take down opponents by using twisting motions of the body.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, Vovinam is probably one of the most comprehensive martial programs. Many people will train Vovinam well into their old age and still not master all the techniques. It is both compelling and humble experience training Vovinam. Compelling because for every techniques mastered there are even more challenging techniques to be learnt. Humble because one will always be able to remain a student regardless of his belt.</p>
